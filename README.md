# About Build

In this project, I created a simple web page for making Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency payment
using a scan-to-pay mechanism.

# Problems

1. **Complexity of Cryptocurrency Payments:** Traditional cryptocurrency payment methods often require users to copy and paste complex wallet addresses, deal with fluctuating transaction fees, and navigate through different blockchain networks. This complexity can deter mainstream adoption.
2. **Transaction Delays:** In some blockchain networks, transaction confirmations can take several minutes or even hours, making cryptocurrency payments impractical for real-time use cases, such as point-of-sale transactions or quick peer-to-peer transfers.

# Project Solution

- **Efficient Payments:** Solana's blockchain architecture enables near-instant transaction confirmations and high throughput, making it suitable for real-time payments.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our scan-to-pay page provides an intuitive interface where users can scan QR codes to initiate Solana payments. This eliminates the need to manually enter complex wallet addresses.
- Therefore simplifying cryptocurrency payments and harnessing Solana's capabilities, the solution aims to make digital currency more accessible and convenient for users and businesses alike. It addresses the challenges associated with traditional payment methods and contributes to the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions.
- Implemented a mechanism to listen for transaction confirmation events.
